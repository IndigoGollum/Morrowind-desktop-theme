# Morrowind-desktop-theme
A Linux desktop theme based on The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind.

==INSTALLATION==
Download latest release, decompress, copy to /usr/share/icons/
Sudo required for this.
Installed theme should look like /usr/share/icons/Morrowind/...

==UPDATING==
Do that again, merge folders and overwrite files.


==LATEST RELEASE==
v0.1. Github apparently doesn't like me trying to upload a folder full of symlinks, and i'm too tired right now to fix it. The released tarball works fine.
