# Morrowind-desktop-theme
A Linux desktop theme based on The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind. This was designed with Linux Mint in mind and i don't know how other distros are different.

==INSTALLATION==

Download latest release, decompress, copy to /usr/share/icons/
Sudo required for this.
Installed theme should look like
```
/usr/share/icons/Morrowind/
                  ⮡ cursor.theme
                  ⮡ cursor-index
                  ⮡ index.theme
                  ⮡ cursors/
                      ⮡ (a bunch of symlinks)
                      ⮡ base-files/
                          ⮡)(a bunch of cursors)
```
==UPDATING==

Do that again, merge folders and overwrite files.

[u/Asteroiderer on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Morrowind/comments/zs5x8t/i_made_a_windows_cursor_scheme_with_morrowinds/) for making a version of this for Windows a couple years ago, and for being so nice about this version i'm making.

==LATEST RELEASE==

v0.1. Github apparently doesn't like me trying to upload a folder full of symlinks, and i'm too tired right now to fix it. The released tarball works fine.
